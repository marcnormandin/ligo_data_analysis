Fully-coherent all-sky search  for gravitational wave signals (Network analysis) from the coalescence of compact object binaries is a computationally expensive task. Approximations, such as semi-coherent coincidence searches, are currently used to circumvent the computational barrier with a concomitant loss in sensitivity. We explore the effectiveness of Particle Swarm  Optimization (PSO) in addressing this problem. This method can successfully locate the global maximum of the network likelihood function with < (1/10) number of likelihood evaluations needed for a grid-based search.
